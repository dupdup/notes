## Data structures

A data structures is a representation of data and a collection of associated operations {% cite open-data-structures -l 5 %}.

Data structures are implementations of _abstract data types_ {% cite open-data-structures -l 4 %}.

### Abstract data types

ADTs (Abstract Data Types) define the set of operations supported by a data structure {% cite open-data-structures -l 4 %}.

An ADT is the interface of a data structure, it doesn't define how a data structure implements the operations {% cite open-data-structures -l 4 %}.

There can be many implementations of an ADT {% cite open-data-structures -l 4 %}.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a procedure that takes input and produces output that accomplishes a specific task {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 3 %}.

An algorithm should solve a general, well-specified problem. A specification for an algorithm should include the complete set of instances it will operate on, and the algorithms output after running on one of these instances {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 3 %}.

A good algorithm is:

- Correct
- Efficient
- Easy to implement

It's often not possible to achieve all three aims.
